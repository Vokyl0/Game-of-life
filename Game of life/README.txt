That is my console version of Game of life written during my studies.
That is how you start the game:
	Set height and width in 3rd and 4th lines of Main class
	Set rules and speed in 5th and 6th lines of Main class
	Set points to be alive at the begining by lifeGame.invertPoint(int a, int b); as in the example
